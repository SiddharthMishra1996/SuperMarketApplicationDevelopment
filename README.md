# SuperMarketApplicationDevelopment
This project is based on the working of a SuperMarket system. It first asks the user's identity(customer or worker of the supermarket) and accordingly give the options of viewing, buying or adding/removing the products. The details of products are stored in a database(which can be updated accordingly) and are accessed using MySQL commands.
